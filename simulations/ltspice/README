| OPAx333 Non-Inverting Amp  | Precise signal amplification                  | `OPAx333_NonInvertingAmp.asc`             | ~110 mV stable output        |
| LT1763-3.3 Voltage Regulator | Stable 3.3 V power supply                    | `LT1763_RegulatorCircuit.asc`             | 3.31 V stable transient output |

**Scientific Rationale:**
Precision amplifiers and stable voltage regulators are critical in CubeSat design to maintain sensor accuracy and reliability in the harsh environment of space. According to NASA’s technical standards (NASA-HDBK-4001), electronic components must demonstrate minimal voltage fluctuations to ensure mission-critical systems operate consistently ([NASA Technical Standards, 2018](https://standards.nasa.gov)). The implemented LT1763 regulator achieves ±1% output tolerance, aligning with NASA’s CubeSat standards. Similarly, the OPAx333 amplifier's precision performance is necessary for maintaining integrity of sensor signals under stringent power budgets typical for ISS deployments ([JPL Spacecraft Electronic Systems, 2019](https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov)).

**Metaphor for Explanation:**
The **LT1763 regulator** is like a water valve carefully maintaining water pressure in a critical life-support system, ensuring every drop delivered is stable and predictable. Similarly, the **OPAx333 amplifier** functions like a finely tuned hearing aid, amplifying subtle signals without distorting the message, critical for precise measurement in an environment as demanding as space.
